-----------End Goal-----------

Build a C-based LogiGate simulator with custom components and a virtual CPU (ofc build out of logic gates) capable of executing instruction sets and rendering *Bad Apple* on a simulated screen.

-----------Bugs-----------
🐞 render_cable_dragging doesnt work when zoomed or world dragged 
🐞 drag and dropping connection points - if only grab part of connection, --> non vertical / horizonal lines

-----------features-----------
📋 Back (cmd Z)

📋 render cables niceer with cubic bezier curve
✅  1 to many cables (many to 1 is an orgate so dont do that - just use or) - basically already implemented with multible cables.

✅ selection box
    ✅ move multiple + con points
    ✅ copy paste multiple (also copy paste single)
    use this box for creating a group / component

📋 make costum components, where i can double click like node group. costum names. and double click to get out. 
    swiches / lights inside a component shoudl dictade the number of input / output pins of that component and actually represent them - or build costum sschnittstelen
    make component size costum to num input outputs
    add dynamic names to it 
    save and load with one click
📋 Build a library of components containing their own logic and having arbtrary number of sources and sinks
    📋 Add a clock component
    📋 Add a multi pixel / screen component
    📋 Add a instruction set input component (vertical bar only with outputs)
📋 download graph into a file and load later (really cool stuff) (.blif file parsing)
📋 Boolean algebra simplifier which reduces logic to fewest gates
📋 Mini computer. with instruction set. that can be run. Instruction inpit element 
📋 maybe even basic compiler??? dream big huh - istruction set


-----------structural -----------
📋 change void functions to int to check if sucessful


-----------optimizations-----------
📋 is there a way to do this without looping over every pin - yes chunkng for mouse cursor. check and loop only the ones in neighbouring chunks
📋 don't render stuff that is off screen
