✅ add inputs and ouputs
✅ implement cables 
✅ render cables simple
✅ user cricle / png to render pins
✅ change connectio s feom node->pin to node->pin 
✅ check if over pin. so it is pin presiscion > node presision
set the connection and the pointer for input of b node is pointer t ouptut of a node 


✅ dynamic array copies pins ans stuff so they exist twice. so when i drag move the node it isnt getting updated in connections i think. 

check that ouputs cant connect to ouput cons. same with inputs

is click and hover on pin? 
if hover mark diff color. 
is there a way to do this without looping over every pin - yes chunkng for mouse cursor. check and loop only the ones in neighbouring chunks

click on the output / inout pins of the nodes to determain if this is an output of an input? 
??? click drag release

📋 implement logic gate logic 
📋 visually show logic
📋 cut cables with right click knive would be cool or something
📋 render cables nice with snapping and corners and such
📋 select multiple 
📋 copy paste multiple
📋 delete nodes 
📋 zoom  
📋 middle mouse scroll around  

📋 change void functions to int to check if sucessful
