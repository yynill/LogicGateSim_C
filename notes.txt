✅ node dragging bug 
✅ render dragged nod differently, maybe z index and outline or something. or make bigger. 
📋 add inputs and ouputs
📋 implement cables 
✅ render cables simple

🐞 think about how to connect inputs to outputs - connections wont cut it. probably something like: input of b node is pointer t ouptut of a node 
    in this way i can also connect nodes to themselves

📋 implement logic gate logic 
📋 visually show logic
📋 cut cables with right click knive would be cool or something
📋 render cables nice with snapping and corners and such
📋 select multiple 
📋 copy paste multiple
📋 delete nodes 
📋 zoom  
📋 middle mouse scroll around
