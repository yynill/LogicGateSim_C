✅ node dragging bug 
✅ render dragged nod differently, maybe z index and outline or something. or make bigger. 
📋 add inputs and ouputs
📋 implement cables 
✅ render cables simple

🐞 think about how to connect inputs to outputs - connections wont cut it. probably something like: input of b node is pointer t ouptut of a node 
    in this way i can also connect nodes to themselves



✅ user cricle / png to render pins
✅ change connectio s feom node->pin to node->pin 
check if over pin. so it is pin presiscion > node presision
set the connection and the pointer for input of b node is pointer t ouptut of a node 

is click and hover on pin? 
if hover mark diff color. 
is there a way to do this without looping over every pin - yes chunkng for mouse cursor. check and loop only the ones in neighbouring chunks

click on the output / inout pins of the nodes to determain if this is an output of an input? 
??? click drag release

📋 implement logic gate logic 
📋 visually show logic
📋 cut cables with right click knive would be cool or something
📋 render cables nice with snapping and corners and such
📋 select multiple 
📋 copy paste multiple
📋 delete nodes 
📋 zoom  
📋 middle mouse scroll around
