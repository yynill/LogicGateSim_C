📋 add and imolement buttona
    ✅ Step
    📋 Back (cmd Z) is hard but i heared its like some tree generation - good practice.
    ✅ Auto Play / Pause -  (x stpes per sec) 
    📋 Speed Control (+ - button)
    ✅ Reset
    📋 download graph into a file and load later (really cool stuff)


📋 render cables nice with snapping and corners and such + dragging ?
📋 cut cables with right click knive would be cool or something
📋 cut delete nodes drag over trash can
📋 select multiple 
📋 copy paste multiple
📋 zoom  
📋 middle mouse scroll around  

📋 change void functions to int to check if sucessful
is there a way to do this without looping over every pin - yes chunkng for mouse cursor. check and loop only the ones in neighbouring chunks
