-----------End Goal-----------

Build a C-based LogiGate simulator with custom components and a virtual CPU (ofc build out of logic gates) capable of executing instruction sets and rendering *Bad Apple* on a simulated screen.

-----------Bugs-----------
✅  main(18878,0x20a2f8c40)  malloc: Double free of object 0x137113fe0 (this is a connection)
✅  cut cables               zsh: segmentation fault  ./main
✅  if nodes on same height, cable connects wierdly. snaps 



-----------features-----------
📋 Back (cmd Z) is hard but i heared its like some tree generation - good practice.
📋 Speed Control (+ - button)

✅ camera pan and zoom

📋 render cables nice with snapping and corners and such + dragging ? (cubic bezier curve)
    when hovered pin for drag dont detect node. 

📋 select multiple 
📋 copy paste multiple

📋 make costum components, where i can double click like node group. costum names. and double click to get out. 
    swiches / lights inside a component shoudl dictade the number of input / output pins of that component and actually represent them - or build costum sschnittstelen
    make component size costum to num input outputs
    add dynamic names to it 
    save and load with one click
📋 Build a library of components containing their own logic and having arbtrary number of sources and sinks
    📋 Add a clock component
    📋 Add a multi pixel / screen component
    📋 Add a instruction set input component (vertical bar only with outputs)
📋 download graph into a file and load later (really cool stuff) (.blif file parsing)
📋 Boolean algebra simplifier which reduces logic to fewest gates
📋 Mini computer. with instruction set. that can be run. Instruction inpit element 
📋 maybe even basic compiler??? dream big huh - istruction set


-----------structural -----------
📋 typedef enum { GATE_NULL ...}
📋 change void functions to int to check if sucessful


-----------optimizations-----------
‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ refactor code
📋 is there a way to do this without looping over every pin - yes chunkng for mouse cursor. check and loop only the ones in neighbouring chunks
📋 don't render stuff that is off screen
