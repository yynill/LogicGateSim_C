-----------Bugs-----------
✅ when i connect 2 cables from different outputs to a inout, to a not gate for eaxmple, it only reacts to one of the both iputs. when it should react as if it was alittle or gate.


-----------features-----------
📋 add and implement buttons
    📋 Back (cmd Z) is hard but i heared its like some tree generation - good practice.
    📋 Speed Control (+ - button)

📋 aAdd a clock component

📋 render cables nice with snapping and corners and such + dragging ? (cubic bezier curve)
📋 select multiple 
📋 copy paste multiple
📋 zoom  
📋 middle mouse scroll around  

📋 make costum components, where i can double click like node group. costum names. and double click to get out. 
📋 Build a library of components containing their own logic and having arbtrary number of sources and sinks
📋 download graph into a file and load later (really cool stuff) (.blif file parsing)
📋 Boolean algebra simplifier which reduces logic to fewest gates
📋 Mini computer. with instruction set. that can be run. Instruction inpit element 
📋 maybe even basic compiler??? dream big huh


-----------structural -----------
📋 typedef enum { GATE_NULL ...}
📋 split inout handeling from sim
📋 change void functions to int to check if sucessful


-----------optimizations-----------
📋 is there a way to do this without looping over every pin - yes chunkng for mouse cursor. check and loop only the ones in neighbouring chunks
